# door-alert-system
An alert system that detects if patients with a certain RFID band are trying to leave the assisted living facility I worked at.
The system also shows what card was swiped in and where.

I made this system alongside @Zidanni

This web app works alongside the DXAccess door management software.

The UI is kind of bad but it works.
